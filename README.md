# ChatterApp
Chat application, built with a Firebase backend.

## About ChatterApp ##

ChatterApp is a realtime chat application I built, using Firebase as the backend for user authentication and message storage. It
is one of the apps that I am most proud of since it is frequently used by my friends and family! 

The idea for ChatterApp first came to me during a Hackathon I was attending. I wanted to create an app in which people at any 
venue or space can simply "shout" anything and everyone there will receive a message. There are no individual chats - everyone
can shout out things for others to hear!

## How I built ChatterApp ## 

I built ChatterApp with the help of Firebase. Since I do not have much experience with databases, I needed a tool which would 
take care of all database work (user authentication and message storage), allowing me to focus on other aspects of the app and
giving me an opportunity to learn how to use Firebase. 
 

## Issues with ChatterApp ##

A BIG issue with ChatterApp right now is that it is missing certain files in this repository and will NOT build at this time. 
I switched computers before pushing my latest version onto GitHub and in the process, lost some valuable data that was stored 
on the old computer of mine. As soon as I have some free time, I will be working on patching up my project so that it runs 
efficiently!
